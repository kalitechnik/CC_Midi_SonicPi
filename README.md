Programming the control interface for TB303, Sonic Pi`s synth.
Touch Osc used as a controller, both with OSC messages, and Midi.
This is my first project done with coding, started to learn coding
with Sonic Pi as my first language at 23rd of March - 2018. 
Thank you Sam Arron for introducing me to the world of coding ;)
